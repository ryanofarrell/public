title: Feedback

Information or opinions that are provided in response to an action or decision. Simple example: I give a presentation, people can give me feedback on what I did well and what I can improve.

There is a fine line between feedback and criticism, and a lot of the nuanced difference depends on the relationship between the giver and receiver. In a formal structure like a company, a manager-employee relationship is set up such that the manager's opinions on the employee's performance is usually considered feedback. In other areas like politics, a journalists opinion on a politician's rhetoric is often considered criticism.

The difference may be the intent of the giver of opinions. However, intent is often hard to measure in public forums like politics, but in smaller settings like managerial relationships intent can be made known easier.
