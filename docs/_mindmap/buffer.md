Buffer is a form of waste that sacrifices value to compensate for inefficiencies and uncertainty in a system.

A simple example of buffer is ordering pizza for a group of people. The last thing you want to do is not have enough, so you order more than is needed. The extra pizza is buffer since it is compensating for uncertainty in demand for pizza.
