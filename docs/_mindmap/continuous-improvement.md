Continuous improvement is a {% include mindmap-link concept="mindsets" text="mindset" %} that drives an individual or team to better themselves every day.

Continuous improvement relies on {% include mindmap-link concept="feedback-loop" text="feedback loops" %} to identify areas that can be improved. The feedback loops can be internally-driven by {% include mindmap-link concept="self-awareness" text="self awareness" %} or external from social influences of events that produce undesired results

Continuous improvement is more related to {% include mindmap-link concept="motivation" text="motivation" %} than it is {% include mindmap-link concept="feedback" text="feedback" %}. People have access to many {% include mindmap-link concept="feedback-loop" text="feedback loops" %} in their day-to-day lives, so the difference between those who use that feedback to get better and those who ignore it is {% include mindmap-link concept="motivation" text="motivation" %} to get better. In other words, if someone does not want to practice continuous improvement, no amount of feedback will help, although feedback may sometimes be the motivation when people are extrinsically motivated or motivated by recognition.
