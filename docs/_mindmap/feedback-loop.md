A method through which the results of an action or decision impact or are returned to the entity that produced them

In business, a simple feedback loop is when an employee gives a presentation and afterwards a manager or peer tells them what they did well or not well.

In person-to-person systems, how the {% include mindmap-link concept="feedback" text="feedback" %} is received is dependent on the receiver of the feedback and the giver of the feedback. Feedback that is too blunt or too radical from the receiver's worldview may be met with anger or denial. Feedback that is too soft may not have a large enough impact to cause change.

Feedback loops are not the same as cycles like vicious cycles or virtuous cycles; the primary difference is that a feedback loop returns results to the instigator, whereas cycles may have intermediate steps. Feedback loops and {% include mindmap-link concept="feedback" text="feedback" %} in general also are more associated with immediacy than cycles.
